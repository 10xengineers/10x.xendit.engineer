                A lot of people ask me why I have <img width="20px"  alt=":albert:" title=":albert:" src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T02NB4B05/albert/d193bf498e3fdb55.jpg"> as my status, well... only those who know knows. <br>
                If you want to know you need to know and to know you need to <img width="20px" alt=":albert:" title=":albert:" src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T02NB4B05/albert/d193bf498e3fdb55.jpg">. <br>
                He's Xendit's secret weapon, he's there in the shadows delivering without fail. <br>

                His enthusiasm and passion for what he is doing is very contagious <br> that it inspires the whole team.

                <p>I used to believe, 10x Engineer doesn't exist like what this website say, <a href="http://10x.engineer" target="_blank">http://10x.engineer </a><br>
                  <img src="./assets/img/post/not-exist.png" alt="10x Engineers aren't real">. <br>
                    But then, I met Albert, the myth version of the engineers.  <br>
                    Who can do every <a href="https://1x.engineer" target="_blank">1x Engineer</a> does, and can beyond that. <br> 
                    He help everybody and doesn't care about himself.<br>
                    An engineer only exist on fairy tale, but it's real. And it's on Xendit.<br>
                    And now I can proudly say that I'm the first person in the world who found 10x engineer, named Albert!
